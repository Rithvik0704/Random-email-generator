# Random-email-generator
This a basic project on generating a random email.

=> I used basic functions like print(), input(), if(), random() and def() function.

=> I started off by defining the random email.

=> Then I stored the random names that is stored in the string 'firstname' and 'secondname'. These random names are stored in a list.
 random.randint() function chooses a random integer in a given range.

=> random.choice() function chooses a random name in the given list. As you can see in the above screenshot I stored the selected random name in 'a' and 'b'.

=> Then I used print() function to print the random firstname and secondname denoted by 'a' and 'b' respectively. Then I convertwd the number to string to print it.

=> If the print function was given like in the above screenshot an error would come like the below screenshot.

=> Then I definied another function named 'another_email' to choose if the user wants another random email. The options are 'y' for yes and 'n' for no.


=> This is the sample output for this program.
